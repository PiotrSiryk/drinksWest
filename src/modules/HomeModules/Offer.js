          There are thousands of cocktail and mixed drink recipes you can choose
          from and mix up. A great place to start is with the most popular bar
          drinks. The list includes the highballs, lowballs, martinis, tropical
          drinks, and shots that have been favorites at bars for years. Most are
          very easy to mix up and are the perfect way to get some practice
          behind the bar.

          Simply put, craft beer is a beer that is not brewed by one of the big
          "mega-brewery" corporations. More often than not, when the phrase
          craft beer is used, this is what it means. However, it is a rather
          imprecise thing to define something by what it is not, so let's take
          it a bit further.
